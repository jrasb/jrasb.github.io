                    The hoger lager project was the first project of the software developer course.
                    During production I learned the basics of HTML5/CSS and JS.
                    This project was made completely without the use of any frameworks and was very
                    "hacked together".
                    <br /><br />
                    The project is a basic game of guessing whether or not the computer rolled a higher or lower
                    dice roll than the player. The player sees their dice after pressing "roll the dice". The option to
                    roll will no longer be allowed without the use of the console to prevent cheating.

                    Cult classic pen and paper game of tic tac toe, now on the personal computer. The game has been once again
                    made with no frameworks or libraries, just vanilla JS and basic HTML5/CSS. This project was our second of 
                    the year and was our introduction into using display: grid.
                    <br /><br />
                    The rules are simple enough. The person who gets 3 in a row, column, or diagonal wins. I made it that it keeps
                    track of the scores and names in the localStorage.

                <p>
                    A classic cellular automata "0 player" game. Popularised by the late John Conway, English mathematician.
                    The "game" is a 32x32 grid of "dead" cells which switch their state upon getting clicked. These cells then,
                    based on preset rules, carry out their life according to said rules. I added 2 buttons, one to go one generation
                    at a time, and another that allows you to generate 100 generations.
                    <br /><br />
                    <h3>Current Ruleset:</h3>
                    1. If a cell is is alive surrounded by 3 cells in its direct neighbourhood, it stays alive. <br />
                    2. If a cell is alive and has 2 or fewer neighbours who are alive, the cell dies of underpopulation. <br />
                    3. If a cell is alive and has 4 or more neighbours who are alive, the cell dies of overpopulation. <br />
                    4. If a cell is dead, and has 3 neighbours, it comes to life. <br />
